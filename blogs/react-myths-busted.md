In the world of software development, there are often strongly held beliefs and practices that become ingrained in certain communities. React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is no exception.

In this post, we’ll delve into some common misconceptions and rigid beliefs — the so-called “cults” — that some React developers hold, and why they can actually **hinder** your ability to write good React code.

## 🧠 The Cult of the Never Spreaders

**Belief:** Spreading operators (`...`) should never be used in React because they are bad for performance.  
**Reality:** Spreading is a common and necessary way to create new arrays or objects in React. Yes, it creates new references, but often that's exactly what you *want* to signal state changes to React.

**✅ Verdict:** 2 out of 5  
Spreading can be misused, but it’s valid and even essential in most cases.

## 📦 The Cult Where Redux Is Mandatory

**Belief:** Every React application must use a state management library like Redux.  
**Reality:** Modern React (with Hooks and Context) can handle most state management needs just fine. Redux is powerful for large, complex apps — but it's overkill for many use cases.

**✅ Verdict:** 3 out of 5  
Redux has its place but isn't always necessary.

## 🏢 The Cult of Condo Components

**Belief:** Components should be nested inside other components to stay “organized.”  
**Reality:** Inline component definitions inside other components can **harm performance** by causing unnecessary re-renders. Define components at the top level when possible.

**❌ Verdict:** 0 out of 5  
Discouraged by React’s best practices and docs.

---

## ❌ The Cult of Anti-Memoization

**Belief:** `useMemo` and `useCallback` are bad for performance and should be avoided.  
**Reality:** These hooks exist to **optimize** performance. While premature optimization is bad, avoiding these tools entirely can also lead to problems.

**✅ Verdict:** 0 out of 5  
They’re powerful tools — use them **when it makes sense**.

---

## 🪞 The Cult That Wants Only a Single Render

**Belief:** Components should render only once.  
**Reality:** React’s core strength is its **ability to re-render** efficiently when state or props change.

**❌ Verdict:** 0 out of 5  
Trying to enforce single renders defeats the purpose of React’s reactivity.

---

## 🛠️ The Cult of Manual DOM Manipulation

**Belief:** It’s better to directly manipulate the DOM (e.g., `getElementById`) rather than rely on React.  
**Reality:** React **manages the DOM for you**. Direct DOM manipulation can break React’s internal state and lead to bugs or performance issues.

**❌ Verdict:** 0 out of 5  
Let React do its job.

---

## 🧬 The Cult of Class Component Hierarchies

**Belief:** Class components should inherit from each other like traditional OOP hierarchies.  
**Reality:** React favors **composition over inheritance**. All components extend `React.Component`, but extending custom components is discouraged.

**❌ Verdict:** 0 out of 5  
Composition is the React way.

## 🧘‍♂️ The Importance of Adaptability

These “cults” are rooted in an unhealthy mindset of rigidity. In software, **adaptability is everything**. React has evolved dramatically — from class components to hooks, from Redux to useReducer + Context — and so should we.

Instead of clinging to dogma, developers should understand **React’s core principles**:
- Reusability
- Declarative UIs
- One-way data flow
- Composition over inheritance

Avoid outdated or misunderstood practices. Instead, write code that is **cleaner**, **faster**, and **easier to maintain**.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

If this post helped you spot a belief you’ve been holding too tightly — that’s great! Growth begins with questioning assumptions.

React is flexible. Be like React.
